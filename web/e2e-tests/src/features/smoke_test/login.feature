    @C1724
    Scenario: Normal user can be logged in and logged out successfully                      
        Then  I expect that the url is "/dashboard"        
        And   I expect that element "userLogo" becomes displayed
        When  I click on the element "userLogo"
        Then  I expect that element "signOutBtn" becomes displayed
        When  I click on the element "signOutBtn"
        Then  I expect that element "confirmBtn" becomes displayed
        And   I click on the element "confirmBtn"        
        Then  I expect that element "signInWithGithubBtn" becomes displayed        


    # Depending of user privilegies, features will be tagged with user 
    # eg @admin, @user1, @user2, etc
    # also this tag user will correspond with user information provided in json file
    # For now this tests can be skipped
